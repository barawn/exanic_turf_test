# Sketch logic for TURF test

We need to merge 4x incoming AXI4-Stream frames into a single frame. This
we already have from existing HELIX stuff, but it's basically a switch with
s_req_suppress logic.

Those go into a DataMover input. The DataMover's control input come from the Ta
port. The status output goes to a switch which feeds the DataMover's control input
along with the Tn input on a second switch input. The output of that DataMover
goes into custom UDP stream logic.

We need to capture the input of the second DataMover's control input (which
contains the length) to start the UDP stream: so you feed that switch output
into a broadcaster. The UDP logic moves through IDLE, HEADER, TAG, and STREAM
states. IDLE is the only time that it accepts the control input, at which
point it moves to HEADER. The HEADER presents the port and length, then in the
TAG state the first data (64-bit tag) is presented. Then the STREAM state
accepts data up to the programmable MTU length or TLAST, at which point 
it jumps back to the HEADER state.
